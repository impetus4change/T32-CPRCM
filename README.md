These are resources from I4C WP3 task 3.2 on convection-permitting climate modelling.

Here you can find and discuss the output variable list as CSV ([data-request.csv](./data-request.csv)).
This variable list is also merged with the data request by the CORDEX FPS-URB-RCC and FPS-CONV initiatives, rendered as an [interactive data table](https://impetus4change.github.io/T32-CPRCM/data-request-i4c-merged.html). 
The merged data request is also available as [CSV](https://impetus4change.github.io/T32-CPRCM/data-request-i4c-merged.csv) under `docs/`
